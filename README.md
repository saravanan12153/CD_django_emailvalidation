Assignment: Email Validation
Remember this regex string?

r'^[a-zA-Z0-9.+_-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+\.[a-zA-Z]+$'

Remember this assignment? Good. Now:

Create an application that asks a user to enter an email address
If the email address is not valid, have a notification “Email is not valid!” display on the homepage

Once a valid email address is entered, save to the database the email address the user entered
On the success page, display all the email addresses entered, along with the date and the time (e.g. June 24th, 2013, 6:00 PM) of when each email record was created

FELISA'S NOTE: 
The screenshots folder is non-standard and is attached to provide a quick view of the templates. These have no bearing on the functionality of the project.
